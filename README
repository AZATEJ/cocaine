cocaine, a sniffer written in C

TODO
- add name resolution for IP (adns, udns, dns.c)
- add checks for IP flags (res,df,mf)
- map hex codes to description (e.g: IP => protocol 6 (TCP) or ICMP => type 0 (echo reply). Now the description between pharentesis is missing.)
- the filter part must be rewritten in order to avoid problems with the visualization
