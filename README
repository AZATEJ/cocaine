cocaine, a sniffer written in C

FEATURES (very basic)
- sniff IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP
- tcpdump filters
- IPv4 checksum verification

TODO
- add name resolution for IP (adns, udns, dns.c)
- add checks for IP flags (res,df,mf)
- map hex codes to description (e.g: IP => protocol 6 (TCP) or ICMP => type 0 (echo reply). Now the description between pharentesis is missing.)
- output in HTLM format. Useful for example when we want to check the sniffer results via web
